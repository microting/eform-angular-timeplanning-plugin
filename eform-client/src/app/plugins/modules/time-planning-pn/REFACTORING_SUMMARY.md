# Unit Testing and Refactoring Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the unit testing infrastructure and refactoring work done to improve testability of the Time Planning Plugin components.

## Refactorings Made

### 1. TimePlanningsContainerComponent

#### Date Navigation Refactoring
**Problem**: Date manipulation was mutating the original date objects using `setDate()` which could cause side effects.

**Solution**: Extracted date manipulation into a pure helper method `addDays()` that creates new Date instances:

```typescript
private addDays(date: Date, days: number): Date {
  const result = new Date(date);
  result.setDate(result.getDate() + days);
  return result;
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Immutability: Original dates are not modified
- Testability: Pure function that's easy to test in isolation
- Reusability: Can be used for any date addition logic

### 2. TimePlanningsTableComponent

#### Cell Class Logic Refactoring
**Problem**: Complex nested ternary operator on line 151 made the code difficult to read, understand, and test:
```typescript
return workDayStarted ? workDayEnded ? 'green-background' : 'red-background' : plannedStarted ? 'grey-background' : message || workerComment ? 'grey-background' : 'white-background';
```

**Solution**: Extracted the complex logic into a separate helper method `getCellClassForNoPlanHours()`:

```typescript
private getCellClassForNoPlanHours(
  workDayStarted: boolean,
  workDayEnded: boolean,
  plannedStarted: any,
  message: any,
  workerComment: any
): string {
  if (workDayStarted) {
    return workDayEnded ? 'green-background' : 'red-background';
  }
  
  if (plannedStarted) {
    return 'grey-background';
  }
  
  if (message || workerComment) {
    return 'grey-background';
  }
  
  return 'white-background';
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Readability: Each condition is on its own line with clear logic
- Testability: Can test the helper method independently
- Maintainability: Easier to modify or extend the logic

#### Cell Text Color Logic Refactoring
**Problem**: Similar nested ternary operator issue on line 183.

**Solution**: Extracted into `getCellTextColorForNoPlanHours()` helper method with clear if-else logic.

**Benefits**: Same as above - improved readability, testability, and maintainability.

#### Removed Duplicate Condition Check
**Problem**: Line 134 had redundant condition: `if (nettoHoursOverrideActive && nettoHoursOverrideActive)`

**Solution**: Simplified to: `if (nettoHoursOverrideActive)`

## Unit Tests Created

### Components
1. **time-plannings-container.component.spec.ts** (163 lines)
   - Date navigation tests (goBackward, goForward)
   - Date formatting tests
   - Event handler tests
   - Dialog interaction tests
   - Site filtering tests
   - Date immutability tests

2. **time-plannings-table.component.spec.ts** (320 lines)
   - Time conversion utility tests (15+ test cases)
   - Cell styling logic tests (10+ test cases)
   - Date validation tests
   - Stop time display tests
   - Edge case handling

3. **download-excel-dialog.component.spec.ts** (155 lines)
   - Site selection tests
   - Date update tests
   - Excel download tests
   - Error handling tests

### Services
4. **time-planning-pn-plannings.service.spec.ts** (96 lines)
   - API call tests
   - Parameter validation tests
   - Response handling tests

## GitHub Actions Integration

### Workflows Updated
1. **dotnet-core-master.yml**: Added `angular-unit-test` job
2. **dotnet-core-pr.yml**: Added `angular-unit-test` job

### Test Execution
The unit tests will run after the build job completes and before the e2e tests. They execute with:
```bash
npm run test:ci -- --include='**/time-planning-pn/**/*.spec.ts'
```

## Test Coverage

### TimePlanningsContainerComponent
- ✅ Component creation
- ✅ Date navigation (backward/forward)
- ✅ Date range formatting
- ✅ Event handlers (planning changed, site changed, etc.)
- ✅ Dialog opening
- ✅ Resigned sites toggle
- ✅ Date immutability

### TimePlanningsTableComponent
- ✅ Component creation
- ✅ Time conversions (minutes to time, hours to time)
- ✅ Number padding (padZero)
- ✅ Cell class determination (10 scenarios)
- ✅ Date validation (past, present, future)
- ✅ Stop time display formatting

### Services
- ✅ API endpoint calls
- ✅ Request parameter construction
- ✅ Response handling

### Dialogs
- ✅ User interactions
- ✅ Data submission
- ✅ Error handling

## Best Practices Followed

1. **Isolated Testing**: Each test is independent and doesn't rely on others
2. **Mocking**: All dependencies are mocked using Jasmine spies
3. **Descriptive Names**: Test names clearly describe what they're testing
4. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Tests follow the AAA pattern
5. **Edge Cases**: Tests cover normal cases, edge cases, and error scenarios
6. **Pure Functions**: Refactored methods are pure functions where possible

## Future Improvements

1. Add tests for the more complex dialog components (WorkdayEntityDialogComponent, AssignedSiteDialogComponent)
2. Add integration tests that test component interactions
3. Add tests for the state management if using NgRx
4. Consider adding code coverage reporting to the CI pipeline
5. Add visual regression testing for UI components

## Running Tests Locally

When the plugin is integrated into the main frontend:

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd eform-angular-frontend/eform-client
npm install

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run only time-planning tests
npm test -- --include='**/time-planning-pn/**/*.spec.ts'
```

## Conclusion

The refactoring and unit testing work has significantly improved:
- **Code Quality**: More readable and maintainable code
- **Testability**: Components and methods can now be easily tested
- **Confidence**: Tests ensure methods work as expected and prevent regressions
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing in GitHub Actions catches issues early

Total test cases: 40+
Total test files: 4
